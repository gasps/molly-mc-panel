# mollyinduced minecraft server panel

this is a project i forked (though i’ve forgotten from who), but i completely revamped it. it no longer uses their source code and has become my own project.

no external libraries or dependencies are used, except for those needed for browser-based applications (i.e., javascript, html, css).

currently, it's compatible with windows 10, but i'm planning to add support for linux, macos, and maybe even mobile. right now, this is intended for localhost only, but i'll expand it to allow remote connections without the need to be local.

started this project on 12/26/24. i have plenty of ideas and plans for the future, so stay tuned!

## requirements
- custom web console plugin – coming soon
- custom web console spigot – coming soon



## how to use?
1. create a "servers" folder if it doesn't exist, then add or create your server inside.
2. find the `webconsole.yml` file in your server folder (for WebConsole Plugin or Spigot).
3. set your WebConsole port in `webconsole.yml`.
4. go to the web panel's "Home" tab, where your server should appear.
5. select your server and set the websocket port to match the one in `webconsole.yml`.
6. select your server again and it should automatically take you to the console, where you can start and stop your server!


## features (more coming soon)
- start and stop server
- web console
